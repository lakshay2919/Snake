How to code a snake game in Java for beginners! Learn how to create a game of snake in Java using the awt and swing graphics library. Throughout the tutorial, you will learn how to create a graphical user interface (GUI) to display the Snake game, create the game loop, listen for Key presses to move the snake, use the ArrayList to store the snake's segments, and check collision and out of bounds for game over.

## Homework:
You can continue working on this project if you like. One feature you can add is a keyListener in KeyPressed to restart the game every time there is a game over. ex) if (e.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_SPACE && gameOver). Inside this conditional statement, you should reset the game to default (clear snakeBody ArrayList, call placeFood(), etc). Another feature you can add after this is keep track of the high score and paint it below the current score. For this you will need a variable to keep track of high score.
